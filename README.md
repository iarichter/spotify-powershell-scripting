# spotify-powershell-scripting

I like to automate my Spotify playlists and these days I use PowerShell for work so I'm writing these scripts in PowerShell! Maybe I'll move to a differnt language in the future but who knows?

After struggling for weeks trying to write all my own API calls and figuring out authentication in PS, I discovered [lennyomg's PowerShell commands](https://github.com/lennyomg/Spotify-PowerShell) which have made all of this much easier! So, get that as a pre-requisit and then read comments in any script for more details.
